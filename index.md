## Course Description
Database systems manage data which is at the heart of modern computing
applications.  This course covers the fundamentals of traditional databases,
such as Oracle and MySQL, and core ideas of recent big data systems. 

Students will learn important problems in data management that these systems
are designed to solve. They will experience with the internal design and
implementation of relational databases. They will also understand the internals
of state‐of‐the‐art big data platforms, namely Apache Spark, and use them on
Amazon cloud (Amazon Web Service). The students will be able to determine the
advantages and limitations of different database systems.
